    <h1>Go testing</h1>
    <p>This page is under construction...</p>
    <p>Who knows how long this will take.</p>
    <p>Why Go. I chose go because it is an exciting "new" language I wanted to learn. Where speed is concerned, a compiled language
            is a must and C is often used because it is also operates at a very low level. Go is "C-like" (Not derived from)
            so enjoys many of these benifits. I am willing to trade off a possible slight performance boost by using Go instead
            of C, which would be less fun and a lot harder not to mention I would loose the abilities of Go. Go is compiled down
            to assembly level code, executed directly on the processor and its garbage collector is fast and latency free. As
            if that wasn't enough, the speed factor is almost certainly outweighed by the concurrency available in Go to utilise
            multicore processing. Go is really fun with simplicity a built in feature. It lots more features than what is listed
            here but they are left to the reader to discover once they to try Go if they have not already. Go engineers.
