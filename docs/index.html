    <h1>Solving Project Euler Challenges using Go.</h1>
    <p><em Why Go?/> I chose go because it is an exciting 'new' language I wanted to learn. Where speed is concerned, a compiled language
       is a must and C is often used because it is also operates at a very low level. Go is 'C-like' (Not derived from)
       so enjoys many of these benifits. I am willing to trade off a possible slight performance boost by using Go instead
       of C, which would be less fun and a lot harder not to mention I would loose the abilities of Go. Go is compiled down
       to assembly level code, executed directly on the processor and its garbage collector is fast and latency free. As
       if that wasn't enough, the speed factor is almost certainly outweighed by the concurrency available in Go to utilise
       multicore processing. Go is really fun with simplicity built-in. It has lots more features than what is listed
       here but they are left to the reader to discover once they try Go if they have not already.
